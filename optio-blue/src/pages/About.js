                <h4>Who We Are:</h4>
                Located in Allenhurst NJ, Allenhurst Dry Cleaners is a store front for
                more than basic dry cleaning. Throughout the 40+ years of operation,
                we have grown and developed into a multi-service production plant.
                Today, we use all organic solevents and provide a deep cleaning to
                liven old and new fabrics, text-tiles, and clothing.
                <br />
                <br />
                <h4>What We Do:</h4>
                We offer laundry services for men's button down shirts only;
                outsourced with a typical turn around rate to be two-three days. These
                men shirts are machine washed and machine pressed, which differs from
                dry cleaning using our organic solevant followed by hand pressing.
                <br />
                <br />
                In addition, we provide tailoring services altering a wide range of
                clothes and text-tile materials. Some alterations include heming,
                letting out or lengthening, side seams, sleeves, tapering, waist,
                cuffs or removal of cuffs, bra cups and more.
                <br />
                <br />
                Every order is packaged in travel safe blue plastic wrap to protect
                the clothes from the weather when leaving the store as well as dust
                build ups and potential moths in closets. The bags also keep the
                pressing of clothes in good condition for traveling. If you're looking
                to clear clutter in your closet, we do recycle hangers as well.
